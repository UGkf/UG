# ðŸ“‹ Update Log

  2025/07/11 1.1.0Released
  
- This is the first version launch of the Mold Development Platform. The platform includes the complete code process for generating UG secondary development C++ programming based on user requirements, platform usage completion, and user communication area. The specific platform content is as follows (C++ programming only):
- Coding Features:
  - User Requirements to Coding Ideas Process: Users input their requirements, and the system generates coding ideas to solve user needs.
  - Coding Ideas to Required Functions Process: When users search for functions, the system generates the required functions to solve the coding ideas.
  - Coding Ideas Function Information to Code Generation Process: After clicking generate code, the system produces code that solves user requirements.
- Compilation Features:
  - For code generated from user requirements, the platform supports code compilation and returns executable DLL files.
  - When compilation errors occur, the platform returns error information.
- UG Secondary Development Community:
  - Users can provide feedback on issues and suggest features that need optimization in the communication area.
- Platform Usage Tutorial:
  - Users can view feature demonstrations in the usage tutorial section.

# Mold Design Development Platform
## Project Introduction
The Mold Development and Design Platform is an integrated platform that combines UG secondary development code plugin design (generating UG code and performing code compilation) with a UG secondary development community for mold functionality.
<br>
The UG Mold Development Platform was created primarily to enable mechanical engineers, process engineers, and other non-professional programmers to complete simple automation tasks through natural language, while also freeing experienced development engineers from tedious API queries and basic code writing, allowing them to focus on core algorithms and complex logic implementation to improve their work efficiency. The platform combines UG secondary development with large model applications, aiming to streamline UG secondary development engineering tasks.

## Main Features
- Supports user input of requirements, the platform will generate UG secondary development C++ coding ideas that can fulfill user needs based on the requirements (users can modify them).
- Supports generating required UF functions for each step based on the generated coding ideas (users can modify them).
- Supports function information query, users input function names and the platform can retrieve corresponding parameters, function descriptions, and related header files.
- Supports UG secondary development C++ code generation, the platform can generate code that fulfills user requirements based on user-confirmed coding ideas and function information.
- Supports UG secondary development C++ code compilation, users can select their desired NX version for compilation to obtain DLL files.
- Supports users viewing history records, allowing direct navigation to corresponding historical records for coding design.
- Supports users viewing past DLL files, users can directly download previous DLL files.

## Quick Start

# TODO
- [x] Requirement-to-code generation
- [x] Code compilation with DLL output
- [x] History & DLL library
- [x] Multi-NX version support
- [ ] Video input support
- [ ] NX OPEN-based UG development
- [ ] Intent recognition
- [ ] Plugin requirement parsing

# Known Issues
- **Early Stage Limitations**: Knowledge base is limited, generated coding solutions may be incomplete. Users can modify ideas and functions as needed.
- **Complex Plugin Limitations**: Poor performance on complex plugin designs, generated code may fail to complete certain functional steps.
- **Version Compatibility**: Currently supports only NX10, NX12, NX2306, and NX2406 compilation. DLL files may not work with other NX versions.
